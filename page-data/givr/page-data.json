The platform functions as a communication platform for Bristolians and Bristolian charities, creating a more equal distribution of resource donations in the city.","info2":"The final prototype was designed after extensive interviews with non-profit organisations in Bristol.","problem":"Our project is addressing the homeless situation in Bristol and the lack of communication between the hubs. During our interview phase with different people from homeless organisations in Bristol, we have realised that the charities from the north of Bristol are dealing with an overflow of resources donated while the ones from the south are dealing with the opposite situation. Therefore, we chose to focus on creating a communication platform which would enable the general public to donate to charities/organisations in Bristol based upon their requests.","process":"Interviews were conducted to gain expert knowledge of the subject and as interviewing homeless people directly was not an option due to their vulnerable status, we decided to go to the organisations dealing with homelessness in Bristol. Themes that multiple interviewees mentioned were the collaboration between the general public and homeless charities, and the uneven distribution of resources between the north and south of Bristol. During our interview phase, we realised that the charities from the north of Bristol are dealing with an overflow of resources donated while the ones from the south are dealing with the opposite situation. Therefore, we chose to focus on creating a communication platform which would enable the general public to donate to charities/organisations in Bristol based upon their requests.","solution":"Research findings led to the idea of a platform which enables communication between the general public, charities and organisations with the aim of bridging the current communication gap and better distributing resources. The prototype was initially planned to allow users to make both requests and offers, similar to Tinderâ€™s matching system . The user would input an item they would like to donate and be matched with the nearest three charities that had previously requested the item. After thorough discussion regarding endless possibilities of items and situations, we chose to add a login screen for charities/organisations only, allowing them to make both requests and offers, while presenting the general public with the nearest locations for donating what local charities/organisations are in need of.  A spokesperson from Caring in Bristol noted during user testing, that the application would be more suitable for smaller, street-based volunteer teams than big organisations. The changes were implemented and the second iteration of the concept was then tested with a representative of Julian Trust, who found the concept feasible and of interest also for his own organisation.","url":"","keywords":"UX/UI design, UX research, Graphic Design, Mobile App Design","videourl":"https://vimeo.com/341074275","contributors":"Alan Long, Ryan Avery, Saara Rautiainen, Teodora Muresan, Nikki Pantony, Rajon Rahman","repo":""}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3019095435"]}
