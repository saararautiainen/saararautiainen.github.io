The user research of the project aimed to focus on the cross-cultural aspect of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in Robot-Assisted Language Learning (RALL) and look into the attitudes surrounding social robotics. We had the opportunity of learning about social robotics from the talented Minja Axelsson, and utilizing co-creation canvases designed by her in our project. ","info2":"The project was conducted in the Autumn of 2020, which called for creativity and flexibility, as the research, ideation and implementation was conducted between two countries on Zoom and Mural.","problem":"Our objective for the project was to research our target users’ attitudes towards social robots, especially in the realm of language-learning. There was an emphasis on cross-culturally, which is why for two target groups were decided on: students from Finland as well as Southeast Asia. We wanted to find out if there were any differences between the cultures in regards to the acceptance of the robot, their cultural needs in language learning as well as their expectations from a social robot","process":"A preliminary user study was conducted with two target groups consisting of Finnish and South-Asian participants. The participants of the study were mostly students or users from a similar age group. The pre-study aimed to focus on the cross-cultural aspect of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in Robot-Assisted Language Learning (RALL) and look into the attitudes surrounding social robotics. The pre-study consisted of semi-structured interviews and a survey, which included questions regarding the participants’ perceptions of robots as language tutors, as well as the impact the robots could have on their language learning goals. The language learning goals of the participants and their attitudes towards social robots did not differ significantly between the target groups, however, there were some differences in ways in which Finnish and South-Asians generally approached language learning, and what they expected from the robot.","solution":"We were able to design a concept of a robot language tutor to accommodate different types of language learners with varying requirements from our findings. Utilizing a human-centered approach in each step of our design process was crucial in order to better understand the needs, motivations, and concerns of our users and thus create a product that is both easy and delightful to interact with. We distinguished three different study topics that students may want to focus on, regarding their learning goals: vocabulary, practical study, and conversation. The design was implemented on Pepper robot and the prototype of the concept was then evaluated by participants who filled out a user evaluation survey. The prototype was received well, but the responses in the final survey, as well as the first one, revealed some hesitation toward interacting with a social robot, and doubts about their skills. The overall attitudes were nevertheless positive and suggested that the participants could see the robot utilized as a motivator for young students, for instance. As the majority of the participants were still rather skeptical, we concluded that within the frames of current technology, robots can help improve language learning by increasing engagement and motivation but still pose limitations. Thus, social robots are best utilized as tools for learning or tutors for extra practice.","url":"","keywords":"UX design, UX research, Social Robotics, Assistive technologies","videourl":"https://youtu.be/GVa0C_OLZcY","contributors":"Ishan Regmi, Venla Kamppari, Saara Rautiaine","repo":""}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3019095435"]}
