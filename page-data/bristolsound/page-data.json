The primary focus was on conducting extensive research on locations, topics and interactions which could be applied to the design of a prototype. The project concentrates on the coming together of these aspects in order to use interactivity as a tool to express emotion and create meaningful experiences.","info2":"We designed an open space which the user could freely explore to interact with the space with their movement. The user would be required to wear headphones that will guide them through a journey, using a location based application downloaded prior to entering. This application will provide audio, varying from chanting crowds to musical performances. The sound level is dictated by the users position in the installation. ","technologies":["Sketchup"],"problem":"During the last few years Bristol has seen demonstrations against housing developers jeopardizing the operating of grassroots music venues, making it clear that it is a political issue with an emotional charge. The aim of Saving Bristol Sound was to convey these feelings to a larger audience through an interactive installation. For this we had to consider ways of capturing such an abstract concept as emotion, which can be reflected in various forms that can be open for interpretation. ","process":"Our research started at an exhibition called Seven Decades of Sound, hosted by the M-Shed in Bristol. It focused on the evolution of the city’s music scene over the last seventy years, and along with providing us inspiration for our topic, it featured a variety of interactive experiences. These included a booth equipped with headphones that users could use to listen to the ambience at various venues. This was of interest to us as it engaged with an audience that may not frequently visit these locales, and succeeded in telling a story of what the Bristolian music scene sounds and feels like. To carry out our future research , we mapped out integral topics, research questions and methods. The focus was on reaching out to Bristolians associated with iconic venues that have either been closed, or under the threat of closure, to gain firsthand information on why these venues are so beloved by Bristolians. Desk research was done to gain deeper understanding on why gentrification has led to this development, after which some on-site observation was conducted at yet another legendary Bristol venue, The Exchange. The field research provided proof of these venues cultivating discussion, social movement and networking opportunities as individuals from all over the South West would gather together mostly for the music, but also the community.","solution":"To pay homage to the Bristol music scene and the lasting impact it has had on the community and individuals, our installation would have to reflect the sentiment these locations hold. The solution was to capture individuals’ specific moments related to venues, something even a newcomer would comprehend as a meaningful occasion.  This would render the installation from being solely informative to it being a purposeful piece, inviting the user to take a journey to the mind of a collective with a strong connection to the music scene in Bristol. By introducing this new perspective, even someone with no insights on the subject would become more acquainted with the topic and evoke an emotional response","url":"","keywords":"Interaction Design, Prototyping, Experience Design","videourl":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/304749700","contributors":"Alan Long, Ryan Avery, Saara Rautiainen","repo":""}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3019095435"]}
